# 🐍 Heretical Honey Dev Log

Welcome to my digital spellbook.

This repo tracks my journey from self-taught witch-in-tech to full-stack developer and founder of **Heretical Honey**, a creator-led, spiritually-infused tech brand for mystics, misfits, and modern seekers.

## 🧠 About Me

Hi, I’m **Karina (aka Cherry Goth)** — a 32-year-old future software engineer building something beautiful out of nothing.  
No degree, no tech background — just grit, curiosity, and a background in self-expression, storytelling, and survival.

I’m currently learning full-stack development with a focus on:
- **Web dev fundamentals** (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, GitHub)
- **Frontend frameworks** (React, TailwindCSS)
- **Backend foundations** (Node.js, PostgreSQL, REST APIs, Auth)
- **AI + Automation tools** to scale creative workflows

I'm also blending tech with spiritual storytelling through the **Heretical Honey** brand — making esoteric education and religious recovery *hot, intelligent, and wildly accessible*.

## 🔮 Project Vision

Long term, I’m building tools, apps, and interactive content for:
- 🧚‍♀️ Queer witches + BIPOC spiritual creatives
- 🔍 Curious minds healing from religious trauma
- 🎀 Anyone who wants depth, divinity, and design in one platform

Think: *Co–Star meets Duolingo meets MySpace… but for witches.*
